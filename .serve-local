# Description: This version of the local website server will use purely local
# resources with no external webiste dependencies.  Use this version of the
# website if you are not connected to the internet.  Files in the scripts
# are used rather than javascript files from other web addresses.
#
# Preliminaries:
#
# To use the purely local version of the web server, first run the makefile in
# the scripts directory:
#
#    cd scripts && make
#
# This will download the verovio-toolkit.js script needed for rendering
# notation examples for the website as well as the musicbox.js script used to
# manage timings for score/audio alignment.  This only has to be done the first
# time, but it would be wise to do it every once in a while, since this will keep
# the verovio toolkit version up-to-date on the local installation.
#
# Also, you need to install jekyll to run the website locally.
# See the webpage: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation for instructions
# to install it.
#
# To run from the comand line, type:
#     ./.serve-local
#
# Then look for the address of the webserver, which should be:
#     http://127.0.0.1:2222
#

bundle exec jekyll serve --watch --config _config.yml,_config-local.yml
